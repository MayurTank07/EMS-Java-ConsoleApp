                        EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (EMS)
 ============================================================================
 
 Project Overview:
 -----------------
 The Employee Management System (EMS) is a Java-based console application
 designed to manage employee records efficiently using a structured,
 modular, and database-driven approach.

 The application follows real-world software architecture principles,
 including separation of concerns, layered design, and reusable components.

 
 Core Features:
 --------------
 ✔ Secure User Authentication (Login & Registration)
 ✔ Employee Management using CRUD Operations
     - Create Employee
     - Read/View Employees
     - Update Employee Details
     - Delete Employee Records
 ✔ MySQL Database Integration using JDBC
 ✔ Professional Console-Based User Interface
 ✔ Modular Package Structure for Maintainability


 Technical Stack:
 ----------------
 • Programming Language : Java
 • Database            : MySQL
 • Connectivity         : JDBC (MySQL Connector/J)
 • Architecture         : Layered / Modular Architecture
 • UI Type              : Console-Based Interface


 Database Integration:
 ---------------------
 • MySQL Connector/J JAR is used to establish database connectivity
 • JDBC API is used for executing SQL queries
 • All database-related operations are isolated in the DB package
 • Secure credential handling through authentication classes


 Package Structure:
 ------------------
 1. auth package
    - Handles user authentication logic
    - Includes Registration and Login functionalities
    - Validates user credentials against the database

 2. db package
    - Responsible for building and managing database connections
    - Contains DAO-like classes for:
        • User Registration
        • User Login
        • Employee CRUD operations

 3. emp package
    - Defines the Employee entity/schema
    - Represents employee attributes such as:
        • Employee ID
        • Name
        • Salary
        • Address
        • Company Name

 4. ui package
    - Manages console user interface
    - Provides professional output formatting
    - Includes headers, menus, success/error messages

 5. main package
    - Contains the Main class
    - Controls application flow
    - Handles user navigation between:
        • Authentication
        • Dashboard
        • Employee operations
        • Logout and Exit


 Application Flow:
 -----------------
 1. User launches the application
 2. User selects Login or Registration
 3. After successful login, user enters the Dashboard
 4. User performs employee CRUD operations
 5. User explicitly logs out or exits the application


 Design Principles Followed:
 ---------------------------
 • Separation of Concerns (SOC)
 • Modular Programming
 • Reusable Components
 • Maintainable and Scalable Structure
 • Real-world Application Flow


 Intended Use:
 -------------
 This application is suitable for:
 • Academic Projects
 • Java + JDBC Practice
 • Console-Based Application Demonstrations
 • Interviews and Viva Presentations
